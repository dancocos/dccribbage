Duffy's has always been a wonderful host and continued that tradition, showing their appreciation by raffling off prizes and (drum roll, please) a new scoreboard.

Among the many prize winners, Navy John won a Jameson scarf, and Brigett won a Jameson sweater.

There is a new game added to the mix but saved for special occasions: Cribbage Wars.

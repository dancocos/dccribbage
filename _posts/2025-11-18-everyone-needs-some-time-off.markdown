Last week was great. We had four, count 'em four, new people show up. Some were experienced players, and the rest were quick learners. Our friend Bob from Massachusetts made an appearance as well.

With the leaves changing, turkeys wondering where their friends have gone, and people hosting families or traveling to join them. Should take a week off for Thanksgiving? I will not be able to attend on Nov 25, but will leave the boards and cards with the bar.

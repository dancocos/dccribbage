Happy New Year everyone time to reflect on a few accomplishments over the year plus of DC Cribbage.

* Hit record attendance where in we expanded to three tables at Duffy's
* Puchased new cribbage boards and cards
* Had a failed experiment table lamps

We'll kick off 2026 on Jan 6, 2026, there are rumors of possible prizes so be sure to attend.

My goal for 2026 is better tracking of the weekly honors.

6pm-8pm
Duffy’s Hill East
1901 C St SE
Washington DC

First the stats. 

Newcomer Jennifer had a high hand of 22 points and Civilian John collected the win. 

As I write this week's update my emotions are much like "Joy & Pain" by Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock.

### Joy

DC Cribbage is all about the people that show up and *you* showed up in force we counted 24 people the largest turn out ever. We also had some visitors from Jersey, not the home of Jersey Mike's the OG [Jersey.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey) Thank you all!

To add to the joy is the announcement of our new home,  [Trusty's](https://trustysdc.com) another local neighborhood establishment. We'll play on the patio, don't worry it's covered and heated. If you're unfamiliar with Trusty's the patio is upstairs, the stairs are just past the front door on the right. Also cheesesteaks, mmmmm, cheesesteaks.

### Pain
February 24, will be our last session at Duffy's. Duffy's has been a consummate host, keeping us filled up with wings and various other fried delicacies, pretzels 🧑‍🍳 👌💋 and making sure we were never dehydrated. 

A special thanks to Belen who lead the effort to establish "The Board" which gave people bragging rights for the week. Thank you!

Steve and Tom, who let me set up shop, it's much appreciated.

Duffy's has been an amazing host and will be sorely missed. Thank you again.

As per the discussion:

A book with the very long title was discussed. [Morning Glory Milking Farm: a Monster Bait Romance (Cambric Creek: Sweet & Steamy Monster Romance Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/Morning-Glory-Milking-Cambric-Creek-ebook/dp/B09BNYYRK7) by C.M. Nascosta. It's certainly going to end up on my white elephant gift list.

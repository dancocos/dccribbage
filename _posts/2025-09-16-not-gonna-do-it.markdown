Reading through the cribbage subreddit, yeah I'm that dedicated to the craft, someone posted their house rule that if someone got a "19" hand aka a 0 point hand they were actually awarded 19 points. Another person chimed in that when they played if you got a "19" you were forced to move back 19 points. Don't worry we're not adding either of those rules to our league.

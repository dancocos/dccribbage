Last week Kelly was the winner and Navy John scored the high hand with 20 points.

As the government shut down approaches one month the impact will widens. To help out some of our neighbors Laurie will be collecting canned goods to drop off at a little free pantry. If you're able please bring something to donate please do.

To learn more about the little free pantries read this article from the Hill Rag.
